# space-yourself

# Purpose

a first attempt at an app in vue, pulling from the nasa search api to get images to display

### Getting it Running:

-npm install

-npm start

## Technologies used

-Vue

## Known Bugs

the app was originally intended to use the NASA photo of the day api but the api was down, so the decision was made to make the app use the search API from NASA instead

This app is untested aside from manual testing and it would be good to add some automated testing
