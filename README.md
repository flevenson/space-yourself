# space-yourself

# Purpose

-a first attempt at an app in vue, pulling from the nasa search api to get images to display

-a user should be able to visit the app, select from the past astronomy photos of the day and also search for an image using a specific search term.

### Getting it Running:

-git clone git https://github.com/flevenson/space-yourself.git

-cd space-yourself

-npm install

-npm start

## Technologies used

-Vue

## Known Bugs

the app was originally intended to use the NASA photo of the day api but the api was down, so the decision was made to make the app use the search API from NASA instead

This app is untested aside from manual testing and it would be good to add some automated testing
